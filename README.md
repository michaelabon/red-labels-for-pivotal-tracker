# Red and Blue Labels for Pivotal Tracker

This Chrome extension for Pivotal Tracker makes it very easy to see which of
your stories are blocked for development.

## Taxonomy

Any of these labels on stories will turn blue or red:

- planner
- blocked or needs <x>

My teams often use `needs assets` or `needs design` to signal our product
designer or `needs detail` to alert our product manager that their attention is
required. We use 'planner' to specify which tickets will be estimated before the next iteration.
